# RSB Specification Gaps Analysis

## Current State: What's Already Strong

### ✅ Well-Defined Core Concepts
- **Philosophy**: String-first design, bash-like ergonomics, practitioner over academic
- **Global Context**: Environment variable system with expansion
- **Function Ordinality**: BashFX hierarchy (Super→High→Mid→Low)
- **Stream Processing**: Chainable bash-like operations
- **Argument Parsing**: Sophisticated flag and positional handling
- **XDG+ Integration**: Self-contained directory structure
- **Sentinel System**: Rewindable operations for clean installs/uninstalls
- **Error Handling**: Fail-fast philosophy with clear messages

## Missing Specification Areas

### 1. Complete Bash Pattern Mapping
**Gap**: While some bash patterns are documented, many common bash idioms lack RSB equivalents

**What's Missing**:
```bash
# Bash patterns that need RSB specification:

# Parameter expansion patterns
${var:-default}     # Default values
${var:+alternate}   # Alternate values  
${var#pattern}      # Remove from beginning
${var%pattern}      # Remove from end
${var/old/new}      # String replacement

# Array operations
declare -a arr=()   # Array declaration
arr+=(item)         # Array append
${arr[@]}          # Array expansion
${#arr[@]}         # Array length

# Conditional expressions
[[ -f file ]]       # File tests
[[ -n string ]]     # String tests
[[ string =~ regex ]] # Regex matching

# Process substitution
<(command)          # Process substitution
>(command)          # Output process substitution

# Here documents and strings
cat <<EOF           # Here document
cat <<<string       # Here string
```

### 2. Standard Library Functions
**Gap**: No comprehensive catalog of RSB's equivalent to bash builtins

**What's Missing**:
- String manipulation functions (trim, split, join, etc.)
- Path manipulation (dirname, basename, realpath)
- Date/time operations
- Network operations (curl equivalents)
- File system operations beyond basic read/write
- Process management
- Signal handling

### 3. Testing Framework
**Gap**: No specification for how to test RSB tools

**What's Missing**:
- Unit testing patterns for RSB functions
- Integration testing with external commands
- Mock/stub patterns for system dependencies
- Test fixture management
- Assertion helpers

### 4. Package/Module System
**Gap**: No specification for code reuse and distribution

**What's Missing**:
- How to structure reusable RSB libraries
- Import/include system for shared code
- Namespace management
- Versioning and compatibility
- Distribution mechanisms

### 5. Error Handling Patterns
**Gap**: While fail-fast is defined, specific error patterns aren't fully specified

**What's Missing**:
- Error categorization (user vs system vs logic errors)
- Recovery patterns for different error types
- Logging and debugging helpers
- Stack trace equivalents

### 6. Performance Patterns
**Gap**: No guidance on performance considerations

**What's Missing**:
- When to use streaming vs in-memory processing
- Large file handling patterns
- Memory management best practices
- Concurrency patterns (if any)

### 7. Security Patterns
**Gap**: No specification for handling sensitive data

**What's Missing**:
- Credential handling
- Input sanitization
- File permission management
- Secure temporary file creation

## Priority for Completion

### Phase 1: Core Pattern Completion
1. **Complete Bash Pattern Mapping** - Document RSB equivalents for all common bash operations
2. **Standard Library Specification** - Define the complete set of built-in functions
3. **Error Handling Patterns** - Formalize error categories and handling approaches

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
4. **Testing Framework** - Define how RSB tools should be tested
5. **Package System** - Specify code organization and reuse patterns

### Phase 3: Specialized Concerns  
6. **Performance Guidelines** - Document best practices for efficiency
7. **Security Patterns** - Define secure coding practices

## Questions for Direction

1. **Scope**: Should RSB aim to cover ALL bash functionality, or focus on the most common 80%?

2. **Complexity**: How much should RSB hide Rust complexity vs expose it when needed?

3. **Extensions**: Should RSB include patterns for things bash can't do well (structured data, networking)?

4. **Compatibility**: How strictly should RSB maintain bash-like syntax vs optimize for readability?

The goal is a complete specification that any developer familiar with bash can pick up and immediately start building reliable tools without needing to learn Rust's type system complexities.
